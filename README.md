# bringSU
 bringSU is an online grocery delivery service. It was created for as a group project for the Software Engineering (CS 308) course at Sabanci University. I and my friends decided to build an e-commerce website (such as Trendyol) for our assignment but after a brain-storming session we came up with the idea of bringSU.
